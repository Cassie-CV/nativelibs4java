= Introduction =

Highly experimental !

Right now if you need decently stable Cocoa wrappings, you should download [http://rococoa.dev.java.net Rococoa].

Discussion on these mappings and their use should take place on [https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList Rococoa's users mailing lists].

= Download = 

Compiled wrappers : [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/macframeworks.jar macframeworks.jar] (not self-sufficient yet : please put [http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/jnaerator.jar JNAerator] in the path at run-time)

Wrappers sources : [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/macframeworks-src.zip macframeworks-src.zip]

Sources of modified Rococoa (TODO test modifications with auto-tests & submit to Rococoa) : [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/rococoa-jnaerator.zip rococoa-jnaerator.zip]

This JAR has not been tested (at all). It may contain many bugs and is only here as a sneak preview of what's going on with JNAerator.

The API is highly likely to evolve quickly, so please don't rely on it too much...

And feel free to tell what you think about it !

= Building =

Download [http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/MacOSXFrameworks/macframeworks.jnaerator macframeworks.jnaerator], then type :
