Highly experimental !

Right now if you need decently stable Cocoa wrappings, you should download [http://rococoa.dev.java.net Rococoa].

Discussion on these mappings and their use should take place on [https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList Rococoa's users mailing lists].

Download the [http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/foundation.jar sneak preview] and give your opinion about it...
