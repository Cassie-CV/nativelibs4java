= Open Computing Language 4 Java ? =

Apart from [http://www.apple.com/fr/macosx/ MacOS X Snow Leopard] developer previews, [http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ OpenCL] implementations are not yet widely available as of this writing.

However, the Khronos Group makes the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/  OpenCL specification and headers] available to the public, so it is trivial to create [http://jna.dev.java.net/ JNA] wrappings for OpenCL using [http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/ JNAerator].

*IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERFORMANCE* : 

OpenCL is a high-performance library and wrapping it with JNA could appear pointless, as it usually incurs very high overhead. However, since JNA 3.1.0, there is a very fast direct call feature that should allow more than decent performance. Moreover, as pointed out by a reader [http://ochafik.free.fr/blog/?p=128&cpage=1#comment-17058 on my blog], the performance hit of setting up a CL kernel should be extremely small compared to the computation amount taking place afterwards.

= Downloads =

Preliminary binary download : [http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/OpenCL.jar OpenCL.jar] (contains Java sources, their compiled classes and the JNAerator runtime - including JNA).

You can also browse [http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/doc/index.html OpenCL/JNAerated's Javadoc].

= Building =

First, checkout OpenCL's project file from nativelibs4java :
{{{
svn checkout http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/ OpenCL
}}}

Go to the `OpenCL` directory and download JNAerator :
{{{
wget http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/jnaerator.jar
}}}

Then launch JNAerator :
{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar OpenCL.jnaerator
}}}

You'll get a neat [http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/OpenCL.jar OpenCL.jar library wrapper such as this one].

You can even generate [http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/doc/index.html the Javadoc] :
{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar -library OpenCL CL/cl.h -noComp
javadoc -classpath jnaerator.jar -d ../doc opencl/*.java -link https://jna.dev.java.net/javadoc opencl/*.java
}}}
