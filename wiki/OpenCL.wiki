Apart from [http://www.apple.com/fr/macosx/ MacOS X Snow Leopard] developer previews, [http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ OpenCL] implementations are not yet available as of this writing.

However, the Khronos Group makes the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/  OpenCL specification and headers] available to the public, so it is trivial to create [http://jna.dev.java.net/ JNA] wrappings for OpenCL using [http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/ JNAerator].

*IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERFORMANCE* : 

OpenCL is a high-performance library and wrapping it with JNA could appear pointless, as it usually incurs very high overhead. However, since JNA 3.1.0, there is a very fast direct call feature that should allow more than decent performance. JNAerator is not yet compatible with this direct call feature but should be shortly, so please come back in a few days / weeks for updated wrappings.

= Downloads =

Preliminary binary download : [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/OpenCL/OpenCL.jar OpenCL.jar] (needs [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/jnaerator-runtime.jar jnaerator-runtime.jar] for now (the content of jnaerator-runtime.jar should shortly be included in OpenCL.jar, please come back in a few days / weeks).

Browse [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/OpenCL/doc the Javadoc]

= Building =

First get JNAerator :
{{{
wget http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/jnaerator.jar
}}}

Then download OpenCL's headers from the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/ Khronos OpenCL API Registry].

Put cl.h, cl_gl.h and cl_platform.h in a subdirectory named CL.

Make sure you have the JDK installed ({{{ set JDK_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_12 }}} on Windows, for instance) or that [http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/libraries/ecj-3.5M6.jar eclipse's latest Java compiler] is in your classpath.

Run the following command on Unix :
{{{
$JDK_HOME/bin/java -jar jnaerator.jar CL/cl.h -library OpenCL -jar OpenCL.jar
}}}

Or this one on Windows :
{{{
"%JDK_HOME%\bin\java.exe" -jar jnaerator.jar CL/cl.h -library OpenCL -jar OpenCL.jar
}}}

You'll get a neat [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/OpenCL/OpenCL.jar OpenCL.jar library wrapper such as this one].

You can even generate [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/OpenCL/doc the Javadoc] :
{{{
java -jar jnaerator.jar CL/cl.h -library OpenCL
javadoc -classpath jnaerator-runtime.jar opencl/OpenCLLibrary.java
}}}
