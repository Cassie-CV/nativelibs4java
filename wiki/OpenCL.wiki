= Introduction =

Apart from MacOS X developer previews, OpenCL implementations are not yet available as of this writing.

However, the Khronos Group makes the OpenCL specification and headers available to everyone, so it is easy to JNAerate wrappings for Java using JNAerator.

= Building =

First get JNAerator :
{{{
wget http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/jnaerator.jar
}}}

Then download OpenCL's headers from the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/ Khronos OpenCL API Registry].

Put cl.h, cl_gl.h and cl_platform.h in a subdirectory named CL.

Make sure you have the JDK installed ({{{ set JDK_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_12 }}} on Windows, for instance) or that [http://ochafik.free.fr/Java/libraries/ecj-3.5M6.jar eclipse's latest Java compiler] is in your classpath.

Run the following command on Unix :
{{{
$JDK_HOME/bin/java -jar jnaerator.jar CL/cl.h -library OpenCL -jar OpenCL.jar
}}}

Or this one on Windows :
{{{
"%JDK_HOME%\bin\java.exe" -jar jnaerator.jar CL/cl.h -library OpenCL -jar OpenCL.jar
}}}

You'll get a neat [http://ochafik.free.fr/nativelibs4java/OpenCL.jar OpenCL.jar library wrapper such as this one].
