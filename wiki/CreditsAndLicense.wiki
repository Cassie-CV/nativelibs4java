The library wrappers are a derived work of the original library, as it is an automatic conversion from (Objective)C to Java that even tries to preserve comments.

This adds to the JNAerator runtime, which is composed of :
 * [http://jna.dev.java.net/ Java Native Access (JNA)] (LGPL license, Copyright (c) 2006-2009 Todd Fast, Timothy Wall, Wayne Meissner & others) : [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/source/list?path=/trunk/libraries/jna/src/com/sun/jna/Structure.java patched] with support for bit fields (TODO: finalize tests and contribute back to JNA)
 * [https://rococoa.dev.java.net/ Rococoa] (LGPL license, Copyright Duncan McGregor... TODO) : unmodified
 * [http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/ JNAerator supporting classes] : Copyright (c) Olivier Chafik 2008-2009
