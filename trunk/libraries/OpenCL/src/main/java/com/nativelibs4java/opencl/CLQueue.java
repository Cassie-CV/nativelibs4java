/**
 * OpenCL command queue.<br/>
 * OpenCL objects such as memory, program and kernel objects are created using a context. <br/>
 * Operations on these objects are performed using a command-queue. <br/>
 * The command-queue can be used to queue a set of operations (referred to as commands) in order. <br/>
 * Having multiple command-queues allows applications to queue multiple independent commands without requiring synchronization. <br/>
 * Note that this should work as long as these objects are not being shared. <br/>
 * Sharing of objects across multiple command-queues will require the application to perform appropriate synchronization.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * A queue is bound to a single device.
